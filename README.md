# D.A.N.N. (Dermatologic Analysis with Neural Networks)

![D.A.N.N. Banner](https://link_to_image/banner.png)

## **Overview**
D.A.N.N. is a lightweight, portable device designed to assist healthcare professionals in resource-limited environments. Using a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model enhanced with synthetic data generated via **Stable Diffusion GAN**, D.A.N.N. achieves state-of-the-art performance in skin lesion classification, with a validation accuracy of **92.77%**.

The device is built on **Raspberry Pi 4** hardware and provides offline functionality, making it ideal for **first-level clinics** in rural areas.

## **Key Features**
- **Portable Device:** Powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 with an integrated 3.5-inch touchscreen.
- **Transformer-Based Models:** Includes ViT, DinoV2, and Swin Transformers for skin lesion classification.
- **Synthetic Data Augmentation:** Enhances performance using GANs and custom LoRAs for underrepresented classes.
- **Explainable AI:** Implements LIME for interpretable predictions, critical for medical applications.
- **Hybrid Deployment:** Accessible both offline (device) and online (Hugging Face Spaces).
